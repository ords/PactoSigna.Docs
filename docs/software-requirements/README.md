# Software Requirements

Detailed software requirements specifications derived from product requirements, each traceable to design outputs and verification tests.

## Structure

This directory follows an SWR-first layout:

- Canonical requirements are maintained as `SWR-*.md` files.
- Requirements are grouped by number ranges (`SWR-1xx` through `SWR-7xx`) by domain capability.
- Legacy epic-level requirement files are removed and are no longer part of this structure.

## Naming

- ID format: `SWR-{NNN}`
- File format: `SWR-{NNN}-{slug}.md`
