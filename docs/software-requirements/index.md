# Software Requirements Index

This directory is organized in a Software Requirements (SWR) first model. Canonical requirement content lives in `SWR-*.md` files.

## Structure

- `SWR-1xx` — Identity & Access
- `SWR-2xx` — Repository Connection
- `SWR-3xx` — Document Management
- `SWR-4xx` — Audit
- `SWR-5xx` — Release Management
- `SWR-6xx` — Signature Collection
- `SWR-7xx` — Training Compliance

## Canonical Source

- Use individual `SWR-*.md` files as the source of truth.
- Legacy epic-level requirement files have been retired from this directory.

## Maintenance Guidance

- Add new requirements as new `SWR-{NNN}-{slug}.md` documents.
- Keep requirement identifiers stable once published.
- Keep traceability links in each SWR file aligned to architecture, design, and test artifacts.
