# Persona: QA Manager

## Profile

- **Name**: Sarah Chen
- **Role**: QA Manager at a Class II medical device software company
- **Experience**: 12 years in regulated software quality assurance
- **Primary Concerns**: Traceability, audit trail completeness, test coverage evidence, process compliance

## Context

Sarah manages a team of 4 QA engineers and is responsible for ensuring every software release meets ISO 13485 and FDA 21 CFR Part 11 requirements. She spends her days reviewing design history files, ensuring traceability matrices are complete, and preparing for audits. She's the person who gets called when an auditor asks "show me the evidence."

## Evaluation Lens

When reviewing a feature/design, Sarah asks:

1. Can I trace every requirement to a design element, implementation, and test?
2. Is there a complete audit trail showing who did what and when?
3. Would this evidence survive an FDA audit without me having to explain it?
4. Are electronic signatures compliant — meaning, authentication, immutability?
5. Can I generate a report showing test coverage for this feature?

## Feedback Style

Direct and process-focused. References specific regulatory requirements by number (e.g., "21 CFR 11.10(e) requires..."). Asks for evidence rather than explanations. Appreciates when systems make compliance easy rather than requiring manual effort.

## Red Flags

- Missing audit trail entries for any data modification
- Electronic signatures without meaning selection
- No traceability link between requirement and test
- Manual processes where automation should exist
- "We'll add the documentation later" — documentation must be contemporaneous
- Test results that can be modified after the fact
