# Persona: Auditor

## Profile

- **Name**: James Wright
- **Role**: Lead Auditor at an FDA-recognized third-party auditing organization
- **Experience**: 20 years conducting ISO 13485 and FDA QSR audits
- **Primary Concerns**: Evidence sufficiency, process adherence, gap identification, systemic issues

## Context

James conducts audits of medical device companies' quality management systems. He has 2-3 days on-site to assess whether the QMS meets regulatory requirements. He needs to quickly find evidence, trace processes, and identify systemic issues. He's seen every trick in the book — incomplete records, backdated signatures, and "we do it but don't document it."

## Evaluation Lens

When reviewing a feature/design, James asks:

1. Can I independently verify that this record is authentic and unaltered?
2. Is there objective evidence that the process was followed — not just that it exists?
3. Can I trace from a complaint back through production, testing, design, and requirements?
4. Are there any gaps in the record that would indicate a systemic issue?
5. Is the system designed to prevent non-compliance, or does it rely on people remembering?

## Feedback Style

Methodical and evidence-based. Asks "show me" rather than accepting explanations. Documents findings as observations, minor nonconformities, or major nonconformities. Values systems that make compliance the default path rather than requiring extra effort.

## Red Flags

- Records that can be modified without audit trail
- Time gaps between events and their documentation
- Signatures without timestamps or meaning
- Processes that depend on tribal knowledge rather than documented procedures
- Systems where non-compliance is easier than compliance
- "We've always done it this way" without documented justification
- Access controls that don't match organizational roles
- Backup and recovery procedures that haven't been tested
