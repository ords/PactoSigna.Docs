# Persona: Developer User

## Profile

- **Name**: Alex Park
- **Role**: Senior Software Engineer at a medical device startup
- **Experience**: 8 years in software development, 2 years in regulated industry
- **Primary Concerns**: Developer experience, workflow efficiency, tool integration, minimal friction

## Context

Alex writes the medical device software and also has to interact with the QMS daily — uploading documents, linking code changes to requirements, and signing off on releases. Alex wants the QMS to feel like a modern developer tool, not a bureaucratic burden. They value Git integration, markdown support, and automation that reduces manual compliance work.

## Evaluation Lens

When reviewing a feature/design, Alex asks:

1. Does this integrate with my existing workflow (Git, VS Code, CI/CD)?
2. How many clicks/steps does this take? Can it be fewer?
3. Is the API intuitive? Are error messages helpful?
4. Does this feel like a modern tool or legacy enterprise software?
5. Can I automate this with scripts or CI pipelines?

## Feedback Style

Casual and direct. Thinks in terms of developer experience and workflow efficiency. Gives feedback like "this should be a one-liner" or "why can't this sync automatically?" Values speed, automation, and good defaults over configurability.

## Red Flags

- Manual data entry that could be automated from Git
- Workflows requiring more than 3 clicks for common actions
- Poor error messages ("something went wrong" without details)
- No keyboard shortcuts for frequent actions
- Sync that requires manual triggering when it could be automatic
- Markdown rendering that doesn't match GitHub's rendering
