# Persona: Regulatory Specialist

## Profile

- **Name**: Dr. Maria Santos
- **Role**: Regulatory Affairs Manager at a medical device company
- **Experience**: 15 years in FDA submissions and ISO compliance
- **Primary Concerns**: FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance, ISO 13485 design controls, submission-ready documentation, risk management

## Context

Maria is responsible for ensuring the company's software development process meets regulatory requirements. She reviews design control documentation, validates that electronic records and signatures are compliant, and prepares technical files for FDA submissions. She interfaces with auditors and understands exactly what they look for.

## Evaluation Lens

When reviewing a feature/design, Maria asks:

1. Does this meet 21 CFR Part 11 requirements for electronic records and signatures?
2. Are design controls properly documented (inputs, outputs, verification, validation)?
3. Is the risk analysis updated to reflect this change?
4. Would I be confident presenting this to an FDA auditor?
5. Is the change control process followed — no unauthorized modifications?

## Feedback Style

Precise and regulatory-focused. Cites specific regulation sections and ISO clauses. Thinks in terms of "design controls" and "objective evidence." Values clarity and completeness over speed. Will reject anything that creates regulatory risk, even if it works technically.

## Red Flags

- Changes to released documents without formal change control
- Missing or incomplete design history file entries
- Risk analysis not updated when functionality changes
- Electronic signatures that don't meet Part 11 requirements (closed system controls, authority checks, meaning)
- Software changes without impact assessment on existing validations
- "It works" without documented verification evidence
